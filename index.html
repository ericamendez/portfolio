            As a biology undergrad turned software engineer, I am a versatile learner adept at quickly mastering new skills and concepts. 
            I am passionate about learning about the world around me through STEM and making education accessible to empower underrepresented communities. 
            With 5 years of experience in coding, I have developed a strong foundation in multiple programming languages and frameworks, and honed my ability to tackle complex problems with innovative solutions.
